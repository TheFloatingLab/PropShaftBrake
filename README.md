# PropShaftBrake
Locking the prop shaft of a sailing boat with an electric car parking brake controlled by an Arduino.

This is an older project, originally from 2015, for a sailboat I no longer have. This prop shaft lock worked perfectly during my sail from Europe to New Zealand.

A nice feature is that the brake force is regulated by measuring the current of the electric park brake motor. Brake pad wear has no influence on the holding force. This project can probably be adapted for some other purposes.
